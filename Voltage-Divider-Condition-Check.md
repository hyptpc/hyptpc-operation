# Voltage Divider Condition Check

The HypTPC consists of tripple GEM system and the applied voltage of each part is controlled by the resistors between them. (Resistor chain) 
So before applying the voltage directly to the HypTPC, the resistance value is measured. The typical value is below. (K1.8BR Log Book #3 p162.)
